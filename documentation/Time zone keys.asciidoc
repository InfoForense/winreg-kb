| DynamicDaylightTimeDisabled | REG_DWORD | Indicates whether dynamic daylight saving time is disabled. +
0 indicates automatic adjustment +
1 indicates automatic adjustment is disabled
| RealTimeIsUniversal | REG_DWORD | Indicates if the CMOS clock is configured by using the local date/time (default) or UTC. +
0 indicates that the CMOS clock is configured for local date/time +
1 indicates that the CMOS clock is configured by using UTC

Notes:

* the relation between the local time and bias is as following:

[source]
----
UTC = local time + bias
----

* the names in the externally stored https://github.com/libyal/winreg-kb/wiki/MUI-form[MUI form] e.g.

[source]
----
@tzres.dll,-931
----

* the TimeZoneKeyName is not always present
* The RealTimeIsUniversal value is not installed in the system by default and is not officially supported by Windows
