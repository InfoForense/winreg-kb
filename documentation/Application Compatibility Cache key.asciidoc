== Application Compatibility Cache Key
[yellow-background]*TODO add some description*

[NOTE]
Several sources claim that the Application Compatibility Cache is part of the
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb432182(v=vs.85).aspx[Application Compatibility Database].
However these claims are not backed by facts since the article does not mention
the relationship between the cache and the database. This document therefore
assumes the Application Compatibility Cache to part of the Windows Application
Compatibility subsystem instead.

[NOTE]
The actual difference between the Application Compatibility Cache and Shim 
(Database) Cache is currently unknown. Be aware that in other sources the terms
can be used interchangeable. Since MSDN explicitly defines
BaseFlushAppcompatCache and ShimFlushCache, there is likely a subtle difference
to what data is cached. Also see: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd837644(v=ws.10).aspx[Understanding Shims].
In Windows also referred to as AppHelpCache?

The Application Compatibility Cache seems to have been introduced in (at least) 
Windows XP. The format is significantly different between the different 
versions of Windows.

The Application Compatibility Cache can be found in the Registry key:

In Windows 2000 and XP:
....
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatibility
....

In Windows 2003 and later:
....
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache
....

=== Windows 2000
Windows 2000 stores Application Compatibility related data in subkeys in:
....
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatibility
....

At this time it is unclear if these subkeys serve the same purpose as the 
AppCompatCache value in later versions of Windows.

The subkeys are named as the executable files e.g. `Uninstall.exe` and have been
seen to contain the following values:

[cols="1,1,5",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Data type | Description
| %NAME% | | [yellow-background]*Unknown* +
[yellow-background]*Names seen: x, 462*
| DllPatch-%NAME% | | [yellow-background]*Unknown*
|===

Also seen values named like `00008 WindowsNT4.0`.

==== Windows 2000 unknown value
The Windows 2000 unknown value is variable of size and consists of:

[cols="1,1,1,5",options="header"]
